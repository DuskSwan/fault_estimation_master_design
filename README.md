# my master's degree design
This is a project I created for my master's degree project. Although the main content of the project has been completed before, I hope to use this opportunity to experience the entire process of creating a project. 

What I hope to achieve include: 

- [ ] Use clear logic and universal project structure templates to manage scripts
- [ ] Use advanced deep learning management tools such as yacs and ignite
- [ ] Use the log management library to record logs reasonably 

### brief introduction 

This project aims to identify faults and determine the degree of faults based on bearing vibration signals. The flow chart of fault identification is as follows

For detailed ideas, see my [paper](.\resource\doc\paper.docx). I will also add a project introduction here later.
